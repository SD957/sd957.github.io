Hi, I am a forth-year PhD student at School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. Guojun Peng. Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree from Wuhan University in 2019. My research interests focus on the intersection of software security and machine learning.
