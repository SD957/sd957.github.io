I am currently a visiting research scholar in the Department of Computer Science at Tulane University, working with [Prof. Jiang Ming](https://cs.tulane.edu/~jming/). Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. (2025) and B.S. (2019) degrees from the School of Cyber Science and Engineering at Wuhan University under the supervision of Prof. Guojun Peng.
